Heart rate zone training is great, but can take a lot of fine tuning to: 
- work out your own zones
- know what factors will vary those zones and by how much

A simpler (but blunter) technique is to use **Rate of Perceived Effort (RPE)**.   
This is basically **How hard it feels**

We simplify this further by using the analogy of effort feeling the same as: 
- Walking
- Jogging
- Running
- Sprinting


## Rate of Perceived Effort (RPE)

We are aiming to be operating at 

- Walk (1: Recovery in between Sprints)
- Jog  (5: Endurance pace but well within limits)
- Race (8 to 9: Race pace for shorter races
- Sprint (10: Flat out sprinting)

We are avoiding that 6 to 7 zone that most people will fall into when trying to train. 

## Why?

For Endurance: 
- To get optimal results, we want to Train Aerobic without any Lactate Buildup in our bodies. 
- To do this we keep below teh Lactate Threshold: 
- This is teh **Severe** section on the graph

For Speed: 
- We want to train anaerobically and this means operating above the 2nd Lactate Threshold. 
- This is the  **Severe** section on the graph

The Middle zone (threshold training:
- Has it's place but not when we are trying to rapidly improve speed and endurance. 
- It is not good at raising either of these characteristics
- It is useful once speed and endurance targets have been reached.
