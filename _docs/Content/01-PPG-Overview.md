The Performance Paddle Group (PPG) is here to raise  your performance levels in racing, touring or just enjoying a paddle. 

These sections will show you how we are structuring training. 
They are deliberately "Bite Size" and as free of Jargon as possible. 

[Polarised Training](https://numbat70.github.io/ppg/Content/polarised/)
   - Training for Endurance and also Speed
   - Not training the "Mid Ground", because this adds little to racing performance
   - (Epic fail on the "No Jargon" :-o )

[Performance Framework](https://numbat70.github.io/ppg/Content/framework/)
   - Tracking, Measuring & Steering Improvements
   - Making a plan (If that's your thing)
   - Not making a plan if you don't need one

[Pathways](https://numbat70.github.io/ppg/Content/pathways/) 
   - This is how you want to structure your training. Is it for fitness, racing, touring, fun etc..
   - (Racing can be fun as well)

[Goals](https://numbat70.github.io/ppg/Content/goals/)
   - What do you want to get out of PPG
