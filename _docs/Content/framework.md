## Measures
As we train throughout the year we will use mostly Quantitive measures (how much, how fast, how long etc...)

Distance
- 200m time
- 1km time
- 5km time

Courses
- 250m technical course time

Endurance
- Average moving speed on endurance races

## What makes a good time
The answer is it depends. 
- Age
- Fitness
- Board
- Conditions
- Did you rush here straight from work and skipped eating etc...
