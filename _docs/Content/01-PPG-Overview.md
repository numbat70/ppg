The Performance Paddle Group (PPG) is here to raise  your performance levels in racing, touring or just enjoying a paddle. 

These sections will show you how we are structuring training. 
They are deliberately "Bite Size" and as free of Jargon as possible. 

- Polarised Training
   - Training for Endurance and also Speed
   - Not training teh mid ground, because this adds little to racing performance
   - (Epic fail on the "No Jargon" :-o )
- Performance Framework
   - Tracking, Measuring & Steering Improvements
   - Making a plan (If that's your thing)
   - Not making a plan if you don't need one
- Pathways 
   - This is how you want to structure your training. Is it for fitness, racing, touring, fun etc..
   - (Racing can be fun as well)
- Goals
   - What do you want to get out of PPG
