Heart rate zone training is great, but can take a lot of fine tuning to: 
- work out your own zones
- know what factors will vary those zones and by how much

A simpler (but blunter) technique is to use **Rate of Perceived Effort (RPE)**.   
This is basically **How hard it feels**

We simplify this further by using the analogy of effort feeling the same as: 
- Walking
- Jogging
- Running
- Sprinting
